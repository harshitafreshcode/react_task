# Project Overview

Hello Sir/Ma'am,

I would like to provide an update on the progress of the project. While working on the API integration, I have encountered some challenges. One notable issue is the inconsistency between the fields in the '/users' endpoint and what is documented. Despite this, I have successfully executed various operations, including 'GET', 'ADD', 'UPDATE', and 'DELETE'.

However, it has come to my attention that the API is not persisting our query responses; it only returns the desired response for the current session. To enhance the user experience, I have also implemented pagination and alert functionality.

I believe I have fulfilled all the specified requirements. If there are any additional tasks or adjustments that need to be made, please do not hesitate to inform me.

## Tasks Completed:

1. Implemented the 'AddOrEdit' component to facilitate the addition and modification of employee data.
2. Developed the 'Employees' component to display a list of employees with corresponding actions.
3. Integrated a delete feature within the table.
4. Created a view profile page for detailed employee information.
5. Utilized the 'https://reqres.in' API for CRUD operations.

## Technologies Utilized:

1. Vite JS
2. React JS
3. React Router Dom
4. Redux Toolkit
5. Material UI
